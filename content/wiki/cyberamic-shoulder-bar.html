The <i>Cyberamic Shoulder Bar</i>, part of Part no. 000-0046, is an A36 carbon steel Bar that consists of two Welded pieces of metal (One long bar on top and another U shaped bracket used to stabilize the top bar to the spine) and has holes used to attach to the arms, neck bracket, and serve as a connection between the pieces in order for the body to turn.

<h2>Variants</h2>

There are no variants that are known of as of now however we could find slight variations later on.

<h2>Measurements</h2>

We have good measurements for the bar and U piece, However spacing for the holes on the two sides and sizes and spacing on the holes in the middle may be incorrect. Holes for the sides are the same spacing and size. Height of metal on both pieces are the same
